GFFT - Generalized Fast Fourier Transformations for Python
==========================================================

This repository is a fork of GFFT package adapted to Python 3.

GFFT is a package for performing Fast Fourier Transformations even in the
case where the data is not defined on a regularly spaced grid. This is commonly
the case in applications such as radio interferometry and medical imaging.


Features include:

  - Fast transformations between regular to regular, regular to irregular,
    irregular to regular, and irregular to irregular spaces.
  - Efficiently use with Hermitian symmetric data. One can store only half of
    the data, and the symmetric data are implied.
  - Handles mixtures of FFT and IFFT along different axes for multi-dimensional
    data.
  - Handles phase shifting of data for arbitrary axis definitions whether
    zero-centered or centered at any other location along the input/output axes.
